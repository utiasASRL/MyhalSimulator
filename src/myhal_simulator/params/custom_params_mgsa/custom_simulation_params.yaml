# world_factory.cpp: use_custom_spawn specify the room in which you want to use a custom actor spawn via coordinates. 
# You can specify the desired actor type in room_params. If using custom actor spawn, num_actors will overwrite the scenario density 
# to the value in custom_actor_spawn_coordinates/num_actors.
#
# Behavior: 
# Since it will spawn the actors of the specified room to the absolute coordinate of the world, 
# using custom coordinates to spawn actors of ROOM A to points (X, Y) when (X, Y) are not in ROOM A
# will lead to ROOM A actually being empty.
#
# Leave empty string if don't want to use, or remove param file.
